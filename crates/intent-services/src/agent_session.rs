//! Agent session driver: drive an ACP turn and route streaming updates onto the
//! M2 event bus (§6.5/§6.6).
//!
//! `intent-acp` owns the wire (session lifecycle + pure `session/update` →
//! [`MappedUpdate`] mapping); this module owns the side effects it cannot: it
//! publishes the mapped updates onto the [`EventBus`] (append-then-broadcast, so
//! subscribed clients receive `events.event`) and accumulates the assistant
//! transcript into the append-only `agent_message` log. Exactly one terminal
//! `agent:stream:end` is emitted per turn — `complete` and `error` both map to it
